I'm tired once again, but this time, it's because I intentionally get up at 6:30
in the morning to do an exercise and head off to work. I've been sleeping poorly
which has usually meant I've not been exercising right. But bootstrapping it
is hard.

If I stay up too late, I can't wake up early to exercise before work.
I'll be too tired when I wake up a bit too early too.

Which means I stay in bed, and nap more. But then I end up staying up too late
since I'm not tired early enough. 

Going to bed early doesn't work, since I'll lie there restlessly for hours.
I'd much prefer not to medicate, as that doesn't always work either.

Therefore the only way out is through: I have to get up early to go to bed early.

I was supposed to receive my NAS harddrives today. Sadly, UPS somehow can't find
my address, let alone try and contact me to resolve the issue. And despite 
a plurality of other times having successfully delivered to me, with the same
address.

So, my NAS remains incomplete for the time being. Hopefully I get this sorted out
before the weekend.
