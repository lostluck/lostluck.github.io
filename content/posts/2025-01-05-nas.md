I ended up buying the parts for a NAS build today.

<!--more-->

It's going to have these parts: https://pcpartpicker.com/list/LBM74p

Which is slightly different than I said yesterday. I changed to the
[JONSBO N3 case](https://www.jonsbo.com/en/products/N3.html) from the N4.
There are a few reasons for the switch. 

The N3 allows for 2 more 3.5 inch drives, as well as a single 2.5 inch one.
I get to re-use the stock cooler for the CPU, which wouldn't have fit in the
N4 case. There's more headroom for a GPU, though it won't fit the 2070 Super
that I currently have, which is 7mm too long for the N3. 

Ultimately, this case lets me grow the NAS in place for a bit more than the N4
would.

In terms of photo workflow, I've started to look at
[PhotoPrism](https://www.photoprism.app/) which seems like it'll be fine even
without a GPU, but still do some automatic indexing and categorizing for me.
