I've given a few talks at conferences, largely about the Apache Beam Go SDK.

## Apache Beam

My talks have centered around the Apache Beam Go SDK, either how it works
or how to understand it. They've been given at Berlin Buzzwords,
Beam Summit, GopherCon, and GopherCon EU.

*TODO(lostluck): call out each talk, and add links to slides, etc. Patience!*

# Playlist

I've collected youtube videos of my talks onto this playlist:
