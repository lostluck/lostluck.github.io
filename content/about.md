I'm Robert Burke.

I'm a Canadian, living in Seattle.

I am a software developer. I enjoy programming in [Go](https://go.dev/). 
I've also used C++, Java, Javascript, Typescript, and Python, but I learned from the experience,
so that's nice.
I currently do so at Google.

I'm a PMC of [Apache Beam](https://beam.apache.org), and work on its Go SDK.

I might be caught running, indoor rock climbing.
I've also been known to sing a capella, as a bass. 
I enjoy playing Destiny 2, and Dungeons and Dragons, 
watching content by [LoadingReadyRun](https://loadingreadyrun.com/),
and support the [Desert Bus for Hope](https://desertbus.org) charity drive.
I've been a repeat attendee of the [JoCoCruise](https://jococruise.com).

The following are also me:
