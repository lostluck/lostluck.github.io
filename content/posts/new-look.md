With Twitter's sudden collapse, it was time to once again refresh this site.

I have been pretty busy since 2022. So many distractions!

<!--more-->

So, first, a new look! This one being a version of the [Coder theme](https://themes.gohugo.io/themes/hugo-coder/).
There are things I like, but others I don't. I do sort of miss some of the extra
post grouping, headers, footers etc. We'll see if those stay important to me.

I had used [smol](https://themes.gohugo.io/themes/smol/) due to how minimal it
was, but ultimately I've decided it was too much so. I had always intended to
make a design project of this site and show off my own personal style.

But time and too many projects makes fools of us all.

Since last time, hugo's recommended Github pages's hosting has moved to a Github
Actions based build. That's great! It's much better than the deploy script that
didn't survive needing to reconstruct my local development repos.

Burning Man 2022 came and went. It was fun! I tried new things that will never
get written about,  but ultimately still feel a bit burned out by the heat and
dust. So I didn't attend 2023 or 2024.

Maybe I'll go next year.

Two further JoCoCruises have happened since my last post. I shutternauted for
both. I learned much about photography, and what I like about it. I haven't
become much faster at processing photos though. When I return to the cruise, I
probably won't volunteer for that again, until I figure out a workflow for that.

I did a big trip to see the 2024 Solar Eclipse. That was great! Got to see fancy
telescopes in New Mexico and other neat sites. And of course, my second Eclipse!
I should write about that trip, but given my track record, I may not.

I might use Elipses to schedule future travel. I may not do Spain/Iceland in
2026, but I've already begun arrangements for Egypt in 2027.

I had my heart broken thought assumptions and missed opportunities.

I gave a few more tech talks, mostly about Apache Beam, and the Go SDK.
In particular I've been working largely on a local Beam Runner in Go, 
which we've called Prism. From my experience on my eclipse trip, I can
say with authority that prism are how you really play with and manipulate
light.

I have an experiment I hope to launch soon, that I'll write about here.
Learning and trying to express those lessons out in the open is powerful.
I'd like to share, and get better at that.

If people find either useful, that would be great.
