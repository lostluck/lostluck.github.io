I left this very late tonight. Between my bus home being delayed and packed and
a work email pulling me back onto my work laptop when I got home, I am left with
little energy and time.

I'm resolved to see this through though.

It wasn't all bad. My evening distractions were simply tighter.

I watched the tail end of the Make Some Noise episode I started yesterday. 

It is the beginning of the Winter 2025 anime season, so I watched the 2nd episode
of Fruitmaster. It's shaping up to being pretty cute for a generic "Overpowered
in a Fantasy World - Non Isekai". Watched the first two episodes of what's almost
"Dr. House, the anime", which was nice since it's a mystery anime. Mystery animes
tend to do two episode arcs, so I wasn't left with cliffhanger for my first taste.

Finally, I played a touch of Destiny 2 tonight. The third and final act of
Episode: Revenant came out today. The new exotic mission Kell's Fall, is neat
and I think it'll be fun to try and discover a few of the secrets myself.

Really, the delays just meant I didn't play even more Destiny this evening.

Saves some for later.
