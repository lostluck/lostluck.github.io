I did a bunch of travel in 2024. 

I intended to do a properly year end reflection, framed around my travel, with a
picture from each trip but time got away from me.
Instead, here's a short summary of the trips.

* March - JoCoCruise through the Caribbean
  * Roomed with a friend from university I haven't seen in ages!
* April - Eclipse Trip through New Mexico and south Texas.
* April - Chicago for a friend's Wedding
* June - Ottawa, Toronto, and Waterloo for an emotionally challenging trip I'm still stuck on.
  * Got to see the show my friend from university directed too!
* July - Chicago again, for GopherCon 2024, and roller coasters!
* September - San Jose, CA, for a work conference, Beam Summit 2024
* November - Japan - Tokyo, Kyushu, Osaka, Kinosaki Onsen, Kyoto, Tokyo
  * I have to go back!
* December - Philadelphia for PAX Unplugged
* Christmas - Solo trip to San Jose del Cabo for an all inclusive resort.

This doesn't include smaller trips to my friend's campsite over the summer either
but then again, I don't get on a plane for those.

I like traveling a fair bit. I should have some more this year, but probably
a little less messy. There's the JoCoCruise of course, and I may end up either
at Burning Man, or in New York City at the end of August. There was also a
wedding in the UK that I recall being queried on... And there's probably a
trip to Rotterdam for a cruise with my parents in October.

I guess we'll find out together.
