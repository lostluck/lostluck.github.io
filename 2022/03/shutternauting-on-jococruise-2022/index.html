				<p>Since 2013, I&rsquo;ve been going on the <a href="https://jococruise.com">JoCoCruise</a>.
It&rsquo;s also where I was when the pandemic was officially declared in 2020.</p>
<p>I got to go back, for JoCoCruise 2022!</p>
<p>It was great!</p>
<p>It was a relief.</p>
<p>It was strange to be on a cruise during a pandemic.
Everyone was kind, and safe, and care was taken.</p>
<p>I got to see friends.
I got to hug them!
Time was spent in the sun, eating fancy foods, and indulging in fruity drinks.
I also got to indulge in what ultimately became my pandemic hobby: Photography!</p>
<p>Perhaps some of the pictures will float up here somehow, though some have already been posted to my <a href="https://twitter.com/lostluck">twitter</a>.</p>
<p>Since I&rsquo;m a helper, I volunteered for &ldquo;Shutternaut&rdquo; duty on the cruise.
That meant I was one of a handful of folks who really wanted to take pictures, and contribute them back for the cruise to use.</p>
<p>While JoCoCruise is a cruise, or a convention at sea, or a set of shows with friends, it&rsquo;s all of that and more.
It&rsquo;s impossible to see it all.
So, we volunteers take pictures to show what the cruise is like.</p>

This was such a great Charon from Hades! <a href="https://t.co/A3r5cTAHDh">https://t.co/A3r5cTAHDh</a></p>&mdash; Robert Burke (@lostluck) <a href="https://twitter.com/lostluck/status/1507430084348559361?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">March 25, 2022</a></blockquote>

<p>I took about ~6500 pictures throughout the week.
About ~1700 of them are worth looking at further.
So that&rsquo;s what I&rsquo;m doing this weekend.
Editing Pictures. Cropping, adjusting levels, and possibly tossing them away.</p>
<p>At the same time, remembering just how good the week was.</p>
<p>We had a SMB server share we could upload things to, and something to take dumps of our memory cards.</p>
<p>I contributed pictures using the camera&rsquo;s companion app, and a random android app I hastily downloaded for the purpose, to upload JPGs from the camera.
I couldn&rsquo;t do much in the way of culling or editing on ship as a result.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m leaning towards doing it again next year, if only to optimize the process.</p>
<p>Till next time.</p>
