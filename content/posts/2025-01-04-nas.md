I'm thinking of building a [NAS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Network-attached_storage).

<!--more-->

Primarily for photo backup purposes.

Over the last few years, I got into photography, but ultimately I've been
stalled in improving.

The root issue, is while I like taking pictures, composing, framing them, I don't seem
to enjoy editing them as much.

It's ultimately a problem of organization. I don't have space.

Once I get going on culling them, it's not so bad, but I'm not quick about it.
So the problem recurs.

In effect, I need to be more ruthless in that regard, in getting the pictures 
off of the SD cards and onto one of my computers' harddrives. But ultimately, I
don't delete the bad photos quickly enough, which makes them accumulate on the 
active hard drives.

This sort of came to a head on the 2024 JoCoCruise. I once again too too many
photos, and then they fill up the harddrive, which means I can't take pictures
off the cards anymore.

And then I become concerned with not losing pictures, both those I've culled and
edited, and those I haven't looked at yet.

Then I ultimately lose track of what I've processed and not.

So I need a better way.

But I can't do that without space.

Hence, a NAS.

I could get an off the shelf unit, but I didn't love the price profiles for them
despite the advanced organization features they provide. I've never been amazing
at adhering to someone else's organizational principals, and it requires a bunch
of additional research to get going.

So I'm building one myself, and probably throwing TrueNAS or HexOS onto it.

I just want something that can expand if I need to, and not have to work on
the cloud primarily. Ultimately, anything truly worth keeping would also be
archived in the cloud, but I hope to keep that set of data to be minimal.

I'd be more tempted to buy something pre-made but I've heard tales that they
don't put good CPUs in there, and I have a 3700X just laying around since I
upgraded my gaming PC.

Overall, I'm looking at some refurbished 20TB drives, and the
[JONSBO N4](https://www.jonsbo.com/en/products/N4Black.html) as a case.
That'll plenty of space for additional drives upgrades, but still compact.
It won't be too tough a build, since without a GPU, the power and
airflow needs should be minimal. I'll need a different low profile CPU cooler,
but everything is dwarfed by the drive costs anyway so that's fine.

I'm looking at using a double parity set up for the drives, and with 4 drives,
that'll mostly be swallowed by overhead. But each additional drive should let
me get nearly the full capacity. I don't anticipate needing it that soon at
least.

But with ~120MB for each raw + Fine JPGs, it'll take a long age for me to hit
that capacity, so I'm feeling pretty safe with rebuild risks.

And with that, I should be able to unblock myself from clearing out my existing
cards, and set up a proper workflow to process my dang photos.
