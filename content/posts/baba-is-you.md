[Baba Is You](https://hempuli.com/baba/) is a delightfully constructed puzzle game from 2017. I like it.

It features a simple but powerful mechanic of putting together rules that modify gameplay.

At it's core you need to get yourself to the goal. You can change the rules to make this possible.

The visuals are simple pixel graphics, of tiles on a grid. You push the tiles around 
to form rules, which take effect immeadiately. 
Rules are ony valid left to right or top to bottom.  If rules contradict each other, the first rule
is kept, and the unused rule is crossed out.

The rules, at their simplest, are structured `NOUN OP VERB`. 

`NOUN`s are colour coded word tiles, with a matching icon out in the game. 
`baba` is paired with a white sheep like icon. 
`tree` with a green pine tree icon. And so on.

`OP`s are joining words in white text, like `is` or `and` or `has`.
They associate `NOUN`s and `VERBs` with each other, or with themselves. There's even a `not`.

 `VERB`s are black text on coloured backgrounds. They're like `push`, `pull`, `stop`, and more.
Each verb imbues one property to associated nouns.

You use the rules to help you move icons and word tiles around so you can win.

The `you` verb defines which nounds are under direct player control, and you need to get
 one of those icons to the same space as an icon ruled as `win`. Do that and you win the level.

By default, only text can be pushed around by whatever is you. 
All other icons are background dressing, unless a rule attaches to their `NOUN`.
All the active rules are on the level grid you're on, and also summarized on the pause menu.

Each area gently introduces you to one or two new concepts at a time, with a few variation on
the theme.
The selection of nouns change up at each to keep the visuals fresh throughout the dozens of levels.

I appreciate that Baba Is You repeatedly makes you re-assess your assumptions about 
how rules work and interact.  There's no time limit for any levels, so you can solve and try things at your own pace.
You can always restart the level, and undo all moves back to the start state, which is
much appreciated.

My only complaint is that there's a bit of a wall between the introductory levels of an
area and anything that's extra, which is a little jarring. This isn't much of a problem
since you can progress through areas non-linearly, leaving challenges to be solved later.
Like many puzzle games, the "AHA!" moments when you solve them are satisfying, because of
how clever you feel.

These simple properties provide a wide range of puzzle possibilities and the breadth of
verbs and ops keep the game interesting.
I've been playing together with friends, by streaming it over [Discord](https://discord.com/).
They can suggest solutions, but only if they've figured it out while watching. 
There's no point if they're just relating someone elses solutions.
If I wanted that, I'd look them up myself.

Once I get to the point of being totally stuck, I may in watch a speed run to learn the best tricks.
