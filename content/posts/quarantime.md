This situation doesn't feel real. Time isn't passing as it normally does. As it *should*.
It's not really a quarantine.

It's Quarantime.

<!--more-->

I dont want to write about the global pandemic, and other world events now. I need more time to think about them. I need to process. 

I do that best by distracting myself. The processing happens in the background.

As such, I'm putting up this site to better catalog all the distractions
with which I'm occupying myself. Distancing can be self care.

I'm very lucky that I'm able to do this.

I don't have much of a plan here. The site itself is a distraction from the
state of the world. I'll probably use it to write about some tech topics, video
games, and other things that I like. 

As for the distractions themselves, I've considered the following to 
work on/try since I'm spending more time at home:

* Read more books
    * Pulpy Fiction (Sci-fi and Fantasy mostly)
    * Dungeons and Dragons texts
    * Design (visual, writing)
    * Computer Graphics
* Learn how to 
    * write better
    * draw better
    * be better organized
* Practice music:
    * playing ukelele
    * sing acapella
    * karaoke
* Play more video games
    * Destiny 2
    * Animal Crossing: New Horizons
    * Torment: Tides of Numenara
    * Anything else from my Steam list.
       * Or that [itch.io bundle](https://itch.io/b/520/bundle-for-racial-justice-and-equality)
* Stream those games on Twitch or YouTube
* Run/Excercise better
* Produce technical content
    * About Go and Apache Beam
* Reflect on what I spend my time on
* Build a Website (nailed it!)

It would probably be better to pick one thing and get very good at it.
But I crave variety. If I can't have variety of location, I'll
settle for variety of task. 

There are other things I could certainly do, but these are the ones
I'm interested in. That's it. Variety is all well and good, but I also have to want
to do it. So I'm not going to adopt a plant, or tend to pets.

You'll note that most of the aspirations require active effort on my
part. It's all too easy to put on a media and not engage with it.
I want to get better at that.

There are many more things I want to do, but presently can't. Like travel. 
I'm going to focus on what I can do.

We'll see how this develops.

Stay safe out there, and wash your hands.
