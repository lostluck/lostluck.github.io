SUPER DRAFT.

<!--more-->

In case you were unaware, there's a global pandemic going
on. This year has seen the end of casual travel, the start of casual
 mask use, stock market lows, and highs, social justice protests, 
police, riots, and the ever frustrating march towards fascism by so
 many world governments. And the year's not even half done.



I'm privileged that I'm able to do this,  that I'm
able to work from home, and make myself productive and 
comfortable while doing so.  Such privilege means that 
my employer ensured that I've got a desk, a good chair,
 and monitor for my laptop. It means I'm able to afford luxuries
like a better microphone and webcam so that interacting with me 
remotely is pleasant.
